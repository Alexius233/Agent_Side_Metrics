        Your task is to analyze a user's movie viewing history and create a detailed user portrait based on the \
        provided information: {{user_id}}, and a {{history}} of movies watched. This history includes \
        some details of  each movie. Utilize this data to examine the user's preferences across different dimensions.

        [Revised Analysis Objectives]
        Emotional Resonance: Analyze the summaries and genres of watched movies to infer the types of emotions the \
        user might be seeking in their movie choices, such as excitement from adventures, depth in dramas, love in romances, \
        or joy in comedies.

        Narrative Preferences: Look into the movie summaries to deduce the user's preference for certain narrative \
        structures or storytelling techniques. Do they favor complex, multi-threaded narratives or straightforward, \
        character-driven tales?

        Thematic Exploration: Beyond genre, explore the recurring themes within the movies to understand the \
        deeper interests or values that might be resonating with the user. Themes could include heroism, justice, \
        exploration, family dynamics, or personal growth.

        Visual and Aesthetic Preferences: Explore the user's potential preference for movies with unique visual storytelling\
        and cinematography, using directors, genres, and summaries, despite the challenge of inferring visual style without\
        explicit descriptions.
